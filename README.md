# Tasty Spoonful

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## About the project

This is a personal recipe website project that is still under construction. I decided to create a recipe website as I have recently gotten involved in cooking and trying out new dishes and wanted to put all the web development skills I have learnt so far and create an awesome website.
It is only a Frontend project where I fetch the data from an API (Spoonacular) but I do intend on making it a fullstack project where I will create and fetch my on data using Node.js and MongoDB. I am still working on this project everyday and will keep adding in features that I find useful. This project is built with React.js, JavaScript, Redux Toolkit and Styled Components. I do intend on updating it to TypeScript and making use of GraphQL.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
Make sure you use your own API key from Spoonacular and set it in the .env file.
